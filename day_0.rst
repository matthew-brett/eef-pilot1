To start:

* Get a study number from me;
* Fill out `this form <https://goo.gl/forms/jDwL5DFZEJAmim8D2>`_;
* Get a consent form from me, ask any questions, sign it.
* Check your setup, by making a new Notebook:

    * Windows, with Anaconda - open Anaconda Prompt.  Type ``jupyter
      notebook``.
    * Mac, with Anaconda - open Terminal.app (maybe from Spotlight).  Type
      ``jupyter notebook``.

  Any problems, ask for help.

Homework

Go to https://www.learnpython.org . Do the tutorial from the first chapter
"Hello, World!", to the chapter on functions. You can miss out the chapter on
string formatting if you like.  We'll use these ideas tomorrow.

    assignment is giving a name to a value
    variable names
    values and expressions "n gets the value 7"
    assignment exercises
    reassigning a variable
    updating a variable
    strings
    lists

.. quotes

    A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We
    have only seen the assignment statement so far. Some other kinds of
    statements that weâ€™ll see shortly are while statements, for statements, if
    statements, and import statements. (There are other kinds too!)

    An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to
    functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an
    expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.

    The evaluation of an expression produces a value.

    family = []
    family.append(random.choice(['G', 'B']))
    family.append(random.choice(['G', 'B']))
    family.append(random.choice(['G', 'B']))
    family.append(random.choice(['G', 'B']))
