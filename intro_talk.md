# What is data science?

> Data Science is about drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data
> sets through exploration, prediction, and inference.

[Berkeley textbook for Foundations of Data
Science](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/what-is-data-science)

# Why is it important?

> ... the really important intellectual event of the next fifty years"
> -- Donoho (2015) "50 years of data science".

# What does it involve?

> ... what data scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data ...
> At ease in the digital realm, they are able to bring structure to large
> quantities of formless data and make analysis possible. ... Data scientists’
> most basic, universal skill is the ability to write code.

Davenport & Patil (2012) "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century"
Havard Business Review.

# It's about getting the answer right

Scientists at Amgen (a drug company) tried to reproduce findings from 53
"landmark" studies.

> ... when findings could not be reproduced, an attempt was made to contact
> the original authors, discuss the discrepant findings, exchange reagents and
> repeat experiments under the authors’ direction, occasionally even in the
> laboratory of the original investigator.

Of 53 studies, only 6 replicated (11%).

# Transparency

> The scientific method's central motivation is the ubiquity of error - the
> awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely anywhere
> and that the scientist's effort is primarily expended in recognizing and
> rooting out error."

# Who is learning this?

* understand what algorithms are, how they are implemented as programs on
  digital devices, and that programs execute by following precise and
  unambiguous instructions;
* create and debug simple programs;
* use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs
* use technology purposefully to create, organise, store, manipulate and
  retrieve digital content

# Undergraduates

> ... academic institutions should encourage the development of a basic
> understanding of data science in all undergraduates -- A 2018 report from
> the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

# What's the down side?

* Learning a new language (Python, or R)
* [The value of
  frustration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxwxefRAu70&feature=youtu.be&t=1803)

# Computers are confusing

* always work with someone else if you can;
* always get someone else to check what you did;
* force yourself to get up and walk away;
* always have a pencil and paper next to you.

# Today

* pair coding: the navigator and the driver;
* if you know what to do, help your partner.
* ask me if you are stuck.
