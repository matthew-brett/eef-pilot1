# Begley and Ellis 2012

Scientists at Amgen (a drug company) tried to reproduce findings from 53
"landmark" studies.

> ... when findings could not be reproduced, an attempt was made to contact
> the original authors, discuss the discrepant findings, exchange reagents and
> repeat experiments under the authors’ direction, occasionally even in the
> laboratory of the original investigator.

Of 53 studies, only 6 replicated (11%).

# Cargo cult science

> In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw
> airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to
> happen now. So they've arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires
> along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in,
> with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo
> sticking out like antennas —-- he's the controller -- and they wait for the
> airplanes to land.  They're doing everything right. The form is perfect
> [...]. But it doesn't work.

# Sceptical

> Science alone of all the subjects contains within itself the lesson of the
> danger of belief in the infallibility of the greatest teachers in the
> preceding generation... Learn from science that you must doubt the experts
> ...
> Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts

Richard Feynman, What is Science? (1969)

# Careful

> The scientific method's central motivation is the ubiquity of error - the
> awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely anywhere
> and that the scientist's effort is primarily expended in recognizing and
> rooting out error."

Donoho, David L, et al. 2009. Reproducible research in computational
harmonic analysis. *Computing in Science & Engineering* 11, 8--18.

# Honest

> It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
> corresponds to a kind of utter honesty --- a kind of leaning over backwards.

Richard Feynman, Cargo Cult Science (1974)

# Transparent

> For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything
> that you think might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about
> it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you
> thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they
> worked --- to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated
> ...  In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help
> others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information
> that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.

Richard Feynman, Cargo Cult Science (1974)

# The difference between true and false

> In studies for which findings could be reproduced, authors had paid close
> attention to controls, reagents, investigator bias and describing the
> complete data set. For results that could not be reproduced, however, data
> were not routinely analysed by investigators blinded to the experimental
> versus control groups. Investigators frequently presented the results of one
> experiment, such as a single Western-blot analysis. They sometimes said they
> presented specific experiments that supported their underlying hypothesis,
> but that were not reflective of the entire data set.

  * data analysis and computing, simulation, models, algorithms.
  * data science, Python and R
  * on working with computers

# Wrong tools, more errors

* Thinking about chance;
* Letting the computer do the hard work.
