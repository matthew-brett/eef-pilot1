Up until now, we've assumed that the chance that a child is a boy is 0.5.  Now
assume the proportion of boys born in the UK is 0.513 [#male-births]_.

Here's a copy of the ``girl_or_boy2`` function above, renamed as
``girl_or_boy3``.  Modify the function to return ``"B"`` (for a boy) 51.3% of
the time, and ``"G"`` (for a girl) 48.7% of the time.

.. nbplot::

    >>> def girl_or_boy3():
    ...     # Return 'G' with probability 0.487, 'B' with p=0.513.
    ...     # Make a random number between 0 and 1
    ...     random_no = random.random()
    ...     # Calculate the return value
    ...     if random_no < 0.5:  # We might want to change this later
    ...         our_result = 'G'
    ...     else:
    ...         our_result = 'B'
    ...     # Send back the result
    ...     return our_result

You can try your function out a few times with the cell below:

.. nbplot::

    >>> girl_or_boy3()
    'G'

If you've got that done, use a ``for`` loop to run this function 10000 times,
and record what proportion of times it returns ``"G"``.  Is the answer close
to 0.487?  It should be ...

.. [#male-births] `Official UK government statistics
   <https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/gender-ratios-at-birth-in-great-britain-2010-to-2014>`_
   give the birth ratio as 105.3. This the number of boys born for every 100
   girls.
